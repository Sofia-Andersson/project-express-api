# Project Express API

Create an express API with at least 2 routes that return single result or an array of elements.

## The problem

My first basic backend-project. 
I created the api by using an database from kaggle.com, converted from csv to json through csvjson.com. I also used postman for testing and all given video-material and tutorials.

If I had more time I would create a frontend page and more relevant routes.

## View it live
