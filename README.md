# Project Express API

Create an express API with at least 2 routes that return single result or an array of elements.

## The problem

My first basic backend-project. 
I created the api by using a database which was given as an example for the project. It was originally found in kaggle.com, converted from csv to json through csvjson.com. I used postman for testing and learned how to create the API from all given video- and livesession material.

If I had more time I would create a frontend page and more relevant routes.
